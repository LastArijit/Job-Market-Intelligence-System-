  <em>Having just graduated, I wanted a clearer view of the job market.</em><br>
But the reality was different.<br>
Messy data. Duplicate roles. No signal — just noise.<br><br>

Tracking it manually was inefficient. So I stopped searching for a solution — and built one.<br><br>

<strong>A pipeline that collects, cleans, and structures job data into something actually usable.</strong><br>
<em>Something you can analyze. Something that reveals patterns.</em><br><br>

What started as a personal fix became something bigger.<br>
<em>So I open sourced it — because this problem isn’t just mine.</em>

# Project Overview
The job market generates an overwhelming amount of data every day, yet most of it is unstructured, duplicated, and difficult to analyze.

This project builds a structured pipeline capable of:

- Collecting job listings from external APIs  
- Cleaning and standardizing inconsistent data  
- Removing duplicates and noise  
- Classifying roles into meaningful domains  
- Storing structured data for analysis  
- Enabling queries to uncover hiring trends and patterns  

The goal is to transform scattered job listings into a clean, scalable dataset that can be used for meaningful analysis and decision-making.

> **Note:** This README serves as an introduction to the project — explaining the pipeline, how it works, and the thinking behind it.  
>  
> The project is also documented in three phases, reflecting how it was built in real time. Each phase captures the challenges encountered, the points where things broke down, and how those problems were solved.  
>  
> This process is a core part of data engineering — understanding where systems fail, and learning how to connect the dots to make them work reliably.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/santifer/career-ops.git
cd career-ops && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation

# 2. Check setup
npm run doctor                     # Validates all prerequisites

# 3. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 4. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 5. Personalize with Claude
claude   # Open Claude Code in this directory

# Then ask Claude to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 6. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /career-ops
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

## How It Works

You paste a job URL or description
